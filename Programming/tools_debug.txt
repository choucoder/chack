objdump: Can be used to examine compiled binaries.
objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A20 main.:

-A20: only display 20 lines after the regular expression main.:
-M intel: intel syntax

GDB: Is used to show the state of the processor registers
right before the program starts.

gdb -q ./a.out
(gdb) break main: pause execution program when it gets to main point
(gdb) run
(gdb) run <arguments>
(gdb) where: show where the programs fail
(gdb) info args: show info about args
(gdb) backtrace: show the backtrace
(gdb) info registers
(gdb) info register address or (i r address): (o octal, x hexad, u unsigned, t binary) (x/t $rip)
(gdb) set disassembly intel: Set to intel syntax
(gdb) list: list info about source code compilated with -g flag
(gdb) disassembly main: Dump of assembler code for function main():
(gdb) x/display $register: Examine memory $register.
(gdb) nexti: The processor will read the instruction at EIP, execute it and advance eip
to the next instruction.
### Commands ###
x: examine
i: instructions
(gdb) i r eip: info register eip
(gdb) x/{number}(x or i){size-letter} $rip: Display the memory as disassembled assembly language instructions
(gdb) nexti, continue, cont: execute the next instruction followed by breakpoint
(gdb) bt: backtrace the stack
echo "set disassembly intel" > /.gdbinit
cat .gdbinit

GCC: Compiler C code.
-g: include extra debuggin information, which will give GDB access to source code

registers:
    (AX, BX, CX, DX): Accumulator, Base, Counter, Data. Act as 
    temporary variables for the CPU when it is executing machine
    instructions.
    (SP, BP, SI, DI): Pointers and indexes. Stack pointer, 
    Base pointer, Source Index, Destination Index. SP and BP 
    store 32-bits addresses, which essencially point to that
    location in memory, for program execution and memory management.
    SI, DI are used to point to the source and destination when
    data needs to be read from or written to.
    (EIP): Instruction pointer, point to the current instruction the
    processor is reading. The processor reads each instruction using
    the EIP register.
    (EFLAGS): using for comparision and memory segmentations.

Intel syntax:
    operation <destination>, <source>
    400527:     48 89 e5        mov rbp, rsp    : mov the value from SP to BP
    40052a:     48 83 ec 10     sub rsp, 0x10   : subtract 10 from SP (storing the result in SP)

Default Size of single unit
    b  A single byte
    h  A halfword, which is two bytes in size
    w  A word, which is four bytes in size
    g  A giant, which is eight bytes in size
